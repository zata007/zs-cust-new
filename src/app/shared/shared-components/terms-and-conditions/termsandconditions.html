    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">User Reviews</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c1">User reviews or ratings for Restaurants do not reflect the opinion of ZataakSe.
            ZataakSe receives multiple reviews or ratings for Restaurants by users, which reflect the opinions of the
            Users. It is pertinent to state that each and every review posted on ZataakSe is the personal opinion of the
            user/reviewer only. ZataakSe is a neutral platform, which solely provides a means of communication between
            users/reviewers including users or restaurant owners/representatives with access to restaurant business
            page. The advertisements published on the ZataakSe Platform are independent of the reviews recieved by such
            advertisers. We are a neutral platform and we don&#39;t arbitrate disputes, however in case if someone
            writes a review that the restaurant does not consider to be true, the best option for the restaurant
            representative would be to contact the reviewer or post a public response in order to clear up any
            misunderstandings. If the Restaurant believes that any particular user&#39;s review violates any of the
            ZataakSe&#39; policies, the restaurant may write to us at contact@zataakse.com and bring such violation to
            our attention. ZataakSe may remove the review in its sole discretion if review is in violation of the Terms,
            or content guidelines and policies or otherwise harmful to the Services</span></p>
